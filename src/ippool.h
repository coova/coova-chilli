/* Assuming that the address space is fragmented we need a hash table
   in order to return the addresses.

   The list pool should provide for both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.

   When initialising a new address pool it should be possible to pass
   a string of CIDR format networks: "10.0.0.0/24 10.15.0.0/20" would
   translate to 256 addresses starting at 10.0.0.0 and 1024 addresses
   starting at 10.15.0.0.

   The above also applies to IPv6 which can be specified as described
   in RFC2373.
