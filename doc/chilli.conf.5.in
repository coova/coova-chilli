.SH NAME
chilli.conf \-  Chilli Configuration

.SH DESCRIPTION

.B chilli 
has many configuration parameters which can either be used on the command
line or in a configuration file. When on the command line, options are
prefixed with two dashes and may or may not have an equal sign, for
instance, these are equivalent:

.I chilli --uamallowed www.example.com --uamanydns

.I chilli --uamallowed="www.example.com" --uamanydns

Options that do not have arguments behave the same way, just without any
equal sign or second argument. When in the configuration file, options must
not have any dashes, but can still be used with or without the equal sign,
as in:

.I uamallowed "www.example.com"

.I uamallowed=www.example.com

.I uamanydns

Options given on the command line take precedent over any options defined in
a configuration file. The default main configuration file is
.I @SYSCONFDIR@/chilli.conf 
which can be overridden using the 
.B \-\-conf
option (or just 
.B \-\-c
for short) on the command line. Configuration files may also include other
configuration files as in:

.I include /path/to/chilli/configfile.conf

Blank lines and comment lines starting with 
.B '#'
are also allowed in the configuration file.

.SH OPTIONS

(prefixed with '--') or in a configuration file. A few options, shown below

authenticating. Each entry in the list can be a domain names, IP addresses,
or network segment. Example:

.RS
.BI uamallowed " www.example.com,10.11.12.0/24"

Where each entry can be made more specific by specifying a protocol and port
in the format 
.I host/network:port
or
.I protocol:host/network
or
.I protocol:host/network:port
where 
.I protocol 
is a protocol name from /etc/protocols,
.I host/network
is just as above (a domain, IP, or network), and
.I port 
is a port number. Example:

.BI uamallowed " www.example.com:80,icmp:www.example.com"

Adding to your walled garden is useful for allowing access to a credit card payment gateways, 
community website, or other publicly available resources.

CoovaChilli resolves the domain names to a set of IP addresses during
startup. Some big sites change the returned IP addresses for each
lookup. This behaviour is not compatible with this option. Domain names in
the list do get updated periodically based on the 
.B interval
option.

It is possible to specify the 
.B uamallowed 
option several times. This is useful if many domain names have to be
specified. 
.RE

.TP
.BI uamdomain " domain"

automatically add to the walled garden. This is done by the inspecting of
DNS packets being sent back to the subscriber. 

.TP
.BI uamregex " host-pattern::path-pattern::qs-pattern"
When chilli is built with the 
.B --enable-chilliredir
option given to the configure script, the

.BR regex(7)
syntax with the addition of 
.BI *
meaning anything (or to not check that field) and any pattern starting with 
.BI !
will be negated in meaning. 

Examples:

.I --uamregex='.google.com$::!^mail/::*'

This will allow all requests to a .google.com host except if the URL starts with mail (links to Gmail). 

.TP

servers. This is convenient for clients which are configured to
use a fixed set of DNS servers. Since the server may not be available,
requests are forwarded to the 
.B dns1
server.

.TP

Use this IP address to instantly logout a client accessing it (defaults to 1.0.0.0).

.TP

option. If the 
.B macauth
option is specified the 
.B macallowed
option is ignored.

.TP
