Welcome to Coova-Chilli! Coova-Chilli is a fork of the original ChilliSpot
project. It is largely backward compatible with ChilliSpot 1.1, but is
actually based on the 1.0 release plus the merging of many other features
and fixes from both ChilliSpot 1.1 snapshots and contributions from
PicoPoint, Coova, and others in the community. For more information on
Coova-Chilli, see:

To get started after cloning git repository:
